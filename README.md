# React Learning Repository

Welcome to my React Learning Repository! In this repository, I am sharing my journey of learning React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## What's included

In this repository, you'll find:

- React code snippets
- Mini-projects built with React
- Resources and tutorials that I found helpful in my learning journey

## Getting Started

To get started with React, you'll need to have some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you're new to web development, I recommend checking out [freeCodeCamp's curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) for a comprehensive introduction.

Once you have the basics down, you can start learning React by reading the [official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), or following online tutorials and courses.
